           <p>My very precious children, Seniha and Ziya, who made me experience motherhood and always supported me on this path of life. Seniha is 16 years old, an 11th grade student. He has an interest in mathematics and science. Ziya is 14 years old and an 8th grade student. He is very good at math and soccer.</p>

           <p>One of the things that motivates me the most in my life is reading. Each book is like a window opening to other worlds. Discovering and learning new things is a passion for me. I especially love reading books on religion, science, philosophy and personal development.</p>

           <p>I have always wanted to play a musical instrument since I was little. I especially liked the violin, but I never had the opportunity to do it. I started learning violin after the age of 33. I played for a long time. I had to take a break for a while due to workload. I continue to practice and improve myself from where I left off.</p>
